# Introduction

Our final Artificial Intelligence (AI) Practitioner project under IBM's i.am-vitalize programme required us to employ AI Design Essentials, alongside the Enterprise Design Thinking (EDT) framework, for the designing process of our project. We also made full use of the IBM Cloud services available, as per our hands-on lab exercises and beyond, so as to bring our AI solution to life.

As a team, we unanimously agreed to help one of our group members, the CEO of a real-life printing company based in Singapore, with the current business arrangement of deploying his staff to perform the role of a live chat agent during working hours on weekdays. This inevitably results in his hindrance to provide immediate answers to many potential customers. We thus developed a reliable virtual agent, named PrintBot, in order to address this underlying issue.

Found in this repository are the slides deck that the team had used for the presentation and the JSON file for the creation of PrintBot using Watson Assistant as extracted from IBM Cloud.

And for those who are curious about PrintBot's capabilities to answer enquiries related to the very-domain-specific printing business, you could test him out via [this link](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/preview.html?region=us-south&integrationID=2479f2d0-0657-49f4-b14b-ff4d13ad1a15&serviceInstanceID=8d13096d-21ed-4bdf-9600-882045e8086d).
(Please note that this link will no longer be valid in time to come as the Lite plan on IBM Cloud will be expiring soon).

Thank you very much.
